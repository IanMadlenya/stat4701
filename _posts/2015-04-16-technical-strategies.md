# Technical Analysis

Technical strategies are derived from technical analysis (TA). Tehnical
analysis usually comes down to using past price to predict the future price
actions of a stock. 

* One major benefit of using technical analysis is that it
  can be applied to securites of any type, whether that is currencies,
  commodities, futures, or equities.

  indicator, and you will usually be late to the party (but in many cases, you
  can still enjoy it).
