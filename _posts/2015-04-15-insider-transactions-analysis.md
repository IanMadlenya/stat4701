  Below, we investigate whether insider transactions can be used to make
  predictions about future prices.

#Intro
Corporate officers, directors, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of a company's registered stock are defined by the SEC as "insiders" and must report all of their purchases and sales of that stock to the SEC. Many believe that insiders have a more accurate handle on the future prospects of the companies they run and a more accurate notion of whether their company's current stock price accurately reflects these future prospects. It is therefore not uncommon to view insider purchases as a signal that the stock is currently undervalued and has high potential for near-term gain and vice-versa for insider sales.

There are of course many aspects to each insider's transaction that make analysis more complex than simply "buy=good, sell=bad". Most share acquisitions by corporate insiders are under the aegis of stock options or similar compensation schemes, limiting how much of their own proverbial skin has been put into the game. Furthermore, since a large amount of an officer's compensation is often stock-based, a decision to sell is not necessarily indicative of negative outlook. Portfolio diversification, and personal cash liquidity needs now and in the near term future (e.g. buying a home this year, or planning to retire in 5 years) are among the plausible reasons why an insider would sell their shares without negative sentiment on the company's future prospects. Our analysis of insider trading as the basis for a trading strategy therefore attempts to differentiate between good, bad, and neutral insider transactions, and use those as signals in a trading strategy.
